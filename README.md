# Predicting-Dropout-from-Medication-for-Opioid-Use-Disorder

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting retention using advanced machine learning techniques and statistical modeling. Using a dataset with numerical features and no missing values, the model aims to identify key factors influencing retention and generate actionable insights for improving outcomes. This repository contains Python scripts for training machine learning models using different techniques. It includes data preprocessing and multiple model training approaches.

## Files Description

### `data_preprocessing.py`
- This script performs data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the dataset for model training.

### `Model Trainer Traditional Machine Learning.py`
- Implements traditional machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to train models.

### `Model Trainer Subset Technique.py`
- This script explores feature selection techniques and trains models on subsets of features to improve performance.

### `Model Trainer Shapley with LightGBM.py`
- Uses Shapley values for feature selection and trains a LightGBM model based on the selected features.
